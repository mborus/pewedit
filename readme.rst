You enter the text in the time proven, user friendly format of morse code.

There are two brightness settings.

- Low brightness shows the "." morse code,

If you typed too fast and made a mistake, the X letter acts as a backspace.

If you leave the row by pressing UP or DOWN, your newly typed letter will be shown as a hint.
You can change any letter my navigating to it and trying again.
